zerl command-line
  - Create new project skeleton
  - Launch server in certain environment w or w/o console
  - Connect to running server
  - (allow for relative project directory)
  - One-off commands sent to running server
  - Generator - new controllers etc.
  - (allow to be used from anywhere in project, ideally.  so generate a new
	controller from with the views directory, etc.  Also give warning [continue
	y/n] if user tries to create a zerl project within another zerl project.

Project
  - Convention over configuration, of course
  - Standard layout
    * config
	  * routes
	  * environment configs
	  * (snames)
	  * (which version of zerl created it)
	  * (modules that must be loaded)
	  * (applications to start)
	  * (logging mechanisms & levels etc.)
    * views
	* controllers
	* static
	* (models?)

Server
  - Recompile / reload templates when necessary
    - Automatically separates and puts into the correct directories
	- Does any connection optimization that it needs to
  - (External commands?  Like to reload templates...)
  - Backend and frontend monitor
  - Javascript auto-refresh framer
  - Launch in different environments
  - Will serve up static if asked to, but issues a warning in production
  - Possibly immediately deploy new js etc., but then in the background compile
	it and swap in the compiled when ready- for fast iterations + full
	optimization...

-----------
routes
  - returns:
  	- {static, Location}
	- {controller, Controller, NewReqPath, NewReq}
